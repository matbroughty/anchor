# Phase 4: Landing Experience - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Marketing site at anchor.band that explains what Anchor is and initiates the signup flow. Shows example profiles to demonstrate the product. Does not include authenticated features - just public marketing to conversion.

## Implementation Decisions

### Value Proposition
- Identity-focused headline: "Your music profile, tastefully done" (or similar)
- Ultra-minimal copy: headline + one-liner subtext only
- Anti-cringe positioning shown implicitly through examples and tone, not spelled out
- Casual/conversational tone: friendly, relaxed, accessible

### Example Profiles
- Curated mock data (2-3 perfect examples, not real users)
- Full profile previews displayed directly on landing page
- Era diversity: classic rock, modern pop, underground/emerging
- Static images (not interactive, not clickable)

### Visual Approach
- Text-only hero section: headline + subtext + CTA, no images
- Short scroll page: 2-3 sections total (hero, examples, footer)
- Lighter variation of profile aesthetic: still calm but differentiate from product
- Prominent single CTA: large button in hero, repeated at bottom

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact headline wording (within identity-focused, casual tone)
- Specific example profile content (artists, bios, captions)
- Precise color scheme for "lighter variation"
- Footer content (logo, links, social proof if any)
- Typography hierarchy and spacing

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Let the product speak through examples" (Stripe-like approach)
- Keep it calm, no urgency pressure in design
- Examples should demonstrate that Anchor works across different music eras

## Deferred Ideas

None - discussion stayed within phase scope
