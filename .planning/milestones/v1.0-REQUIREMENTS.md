## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Social engagement (likes/follows/comments) | Creates moderation burden, shifts focus from music to metrics |
| Monetization/payments in v1 | Complexity explosion (compliance, support), distracts from core value |
| Heavy customization/themes | Choice paralysis, ugly pages, contradicts opinionated design philosophy |
| Real-time Spotify sync | Privacy concerns, rate limit issues, unnecessary complexity |
| Multiple Spotify accounts | UX/data model complexity, focus on solo artists first |
| Custom domain support in v1 | DNS complexity, support burden for MVP |
| Email capture/newsletter | GDPR compliance, infrastructure overhead |
| Playlist embedding | Album-first philosophy, playlists too casual |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 28 of 28 v1 requirements (100%)

**Implementation Notes:**

- AUTH-04: Implemented with KMS encryption using consistent encryption context (purpose: spotify-token, app: anchor)
- AUTH-05: Token refresh handled automatically by NextAuth v5 and Spotify OAuth flow
- PROF-01: Handle uniqueness enforced via DynamoDB transactions to prevent race conditions
- DATA-02: Album derivation uses weighted popularity scoring from top 50 tracks
- DATA-05: 24-hour cooldown enforced at PROFILE#METADATA level for efficient checks
- AI-01/AI-02: Anti-cringe rules implemented as exported constant for reuse in tests
- PAGE-04: Open Graph metadata with generic OG image (per-handle images deferred to v2)
- PAGE-06: ISR caching (1-hour revalidation) ensures zero Spotify API calls during public page views

**Adjusted:** None - all requirements implemented as specified

**Dropped:** None - full scope delivered

**Gaps Identified (deferred to v1.1):**

- Profile → Dashboard navigation missing (integration gap)
- New user onboarding flow incomplete at profile page
- Middleware doesn't protect /dashboard route consistently
